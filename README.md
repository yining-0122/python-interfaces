# python-interfaces
Here I present the interfaces for widely used accelerator-simulation tools including General Particle Tracer and Genesis.

# python-GPT
The python GPT interfaces shares the following features:

(1) Making GPT input file and run GPT. Therefore you can carry out parameter scans quickly.  

(2) Organizing the GPT output as a PandasDataframe and doing the post-processing, including calculating phasespace, r.m.s values and the transfermatrix from entrance to exit.

(3) Runing GPT-MR optimizer

(4) Plotting beamline layout and phasespaces.
