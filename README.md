# python-interfaces
Here I present the interfaces for widely used accelerator-simulation tools including General Particle Tracer and Genesis.

# 1. Python-GPT
The Python GPT interface includes the following features:

**Creating GPT Input Files and Running GPT**: This allows for quick parameter scans.

**Organizing GPT Output**: Output is organized into a Pandas DataFrame for post-processing, which includes calculating phase space, RMS values, and the transfer matrix from entrance to exit.

**Running GPT-MR Optimizer**

**Plotting Beamline Layout and Phase Spaces**

## 1.1 Single run
All the parameters and beamline elements are organized as python dictionary. 

To start your project, define your beamline using ```YGPT_file.beamline_element()```. For exampleï¼š 

```asm
beamline_element['sol'] = 'bzsolenoid("bend", "z", sol1_z, sol1_R, sol1_L, sol1_nI);'
```

Parameters referenced in the beamline elements should be defined in  ```YGPT_file.element_parameter()```, like 

```asm
element_para['sol1_z']= 0.5.
```

The dictionary keys should match the variable names used in beamline_element.

After defining your beamline, write input and output elements in  ```YGPT_file.input_beam()``` and ```output_beam()```.

Once the beamline is complete, go to the main function. You can use beamline_onoff dictionary to control your elements. to control your elements. For instance, to turn off the solenoid, set:

```asm
beamline_onoff['sol]='off'
```

This will prevent solenoid elements from being written to the input file, which can be useful for comparing different configurations. Ensure that every element defined in ```YGPT_file.beamline_element()``` is set to either "on" or 'off'.

You can then call the methods ```YGPT_file.element_parameter(dict)```, ```YGPT_file.beamline_element(beamline_onoff)```, ```YGPT_file.input_beam(dict)``` and ```YGPT_file.output_beam(dict)``` to create the input files, passing any scanning parameters through dictionaries.

Use ```YGPT_run.GptRun()``` to run the simulation. A 'beep' sound will notify you when the run is finished.

For post-processing, use ```YGPT_process.processing()```Refer to the comments for detailed instructions. The timestamp and simulated parameters will be saved by ```YGPT_file.save_database(database_dict)```.

## MR optimizer

To use the MR optimizer, call ```YGPT_file.opt()``` and ```YGPT_file.output_opt()``` to write the scanning file. Then, use YGPT_run.GptOpt() instead of ```YGPT_run.GptRun()``` to execute the run.
